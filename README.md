# MAD-and-ATV

With support for the almighty A95X F1 coming to an end, a stable of reliable scanning for Map-a-Droid, and other ATV's such as the T95 showing lack of supply on the market the question has come up.. what ATV do you get next?

I'm creating the little write up to pull the focus on what I've discovered, what I've researched and what I see currently in the slightly split resouces around for knowing what ATV's are good to go and what are not. 

Head over to the Wiki for all of the infomation related to the topic.
